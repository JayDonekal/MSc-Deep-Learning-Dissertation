APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA ANALYTICS IN THE ANALYSIS AND EVALUTION OF TEST COLLECTIONS

The dissertation research develops and evaluates various machine learning and neural network architectures in the process of verifying the user made relevance judgements. Continuing, the user qualifications defined by their academic degrees are analysed for their effects on the performance in making relevance judgements. Finally, the method involved in the collection of user relevance judgments are evaluated, under the assumption of the collection environment. As the dissertation follows primarily an experimental approach, most of the findings are likely to be presented in a theoretical fashion.

The dissertation utilizes machine learning to infer good and bad relevance judgements that are made in the test collection process. Further, the dissertation peeks into analysing data trends to unravel the best attributes that could assist the test collection process. This, mainly done in the objective of achieving the following:
Q1.	Develop a machine learning algorithm to differentiate between good or bad relevance judgments based on the user characteristics.
Q2.	Inspect usresâ€™ qualification to identify their contributions as assessors.
Q3.	Inspect the variations caused between the method of test collections.
