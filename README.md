APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA ANALYTICS IN THE ANALYSIS AND EVALUTION OF TEST COLLECTIONS

The dissertation research develops and evaluates various machine learning and neural network architectures in the process of verifying the user made relevance judgements. Continuing, the user qualifications defined by their academic degrees are analysed for their effects on the performance in making relevance judgements. Finally, the method involved in the collection of user relevance judgments are evaluated, under the assumption of the collection environment. As the dissertation follows primarily an experimental approach, most of the findings are likely to be presented in a theoretical fashion.
